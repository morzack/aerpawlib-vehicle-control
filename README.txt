aerpawlib

This is a python3 package that can be used to write scripts compatible with
our dedicated script runner and environment. By using this library, you're
able to take advantage of a few existing frameworks when building your script.

To install as a local library (this maintains a dynamic link to this dir):
    pip install -e .

Usage:
    import aerpawlib

Examples will be written later
