# aerpawlib tests

This is really just a place to throw some tests and give myself a bit of extra sanity when writing weird code.
Most things that go in this library probably can't be easily tested w/out writing some kind of mocking library, so why bother.

This is a good place for future work to be done, especially if we end up releasing the lib to the public or anything like that.

## Running tests

Tests are built using `pytest`

```
aerpawlib/test >> pip install -U pytest

aerpawlib/test >> pytest
```
